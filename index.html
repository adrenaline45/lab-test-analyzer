        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>We give you high-quality, science-backed information about your personal lab test results. Standard lab tests work
          based on "normal" ranges, which only tell you if you're not sick. At Lab Test Analyzer, we've spent thousandsof
          hours determining the true optimal ranges for health - and we'll tell you what you need to do to get there.</p>

        <p class="questions__answer">Typically, “normal” or reference ranges are generated using a method called normoreferencing. That is, data from
          all the people who have taken the test are combined in a statistical analysis, and the middle 95% of the data points
          are considered “normal” or “in reference range.”
          <br>
          <br> Because different lab companies use different machines and may test people in different geographical regions,
          each company develops their own reference range.
          <br>
          <br> Having a normal or in reference range lab results may not mean you are healthy, especially because most people
          only get blood tests when they are sick.
          <br>
          <br> For these reasons, our science team provides “optimal” ranges, based on current scientific knowledge about each
          marker and its significance for ensuring your long-term health.
          <br>
          <br> The final result is a product that can not only tell you if your levels are “normal,” but which can also help
          you further tweak and refine your lifestyle and diet to minimize your risk of disease and maximize your well-being.

          <br> For these reasons, our science team provides “optimal” ranges, based on current scientific knowledge about each
          marker and its significance for ensuring your long-term health.

          <br> The final result is a product that can not only tell you if your levels are “normal,” but which can also help
          you further tweak and refine your lifestyle and diet to minimize your risk of disease and maximize your well-being.

        <p class="questions__answer">Typically, “normal” or reference ranges are generated using a method called normoreferencing. That is, data from
          all the people who have taken the test are combined in a statistical analysis, and the middle 95% of the data points
          are considered “normal” or “in reference range.”
